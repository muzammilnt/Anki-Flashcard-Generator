# Anki Flashcard Generator

## Overview

A simple tool for creating vocabulary flashcards in Anki. This project is designed for people who want to improve their English vocabulary or expand their word knowledge. For example, when reading a book and encountering an unfamiliar word, you can quickly add it to your flashcards with a definition, example sentences, and optional pronunciation.
